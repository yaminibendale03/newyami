selenium :
=========
--  Selenium is a powerful open-source framework that enables automated testing of web applications across multiple browsers and platforms
-- to automate repetitive tasks, test web applications, and ensure their functionality across different browsers and platforms.
--  With Selenium framework, manual testing efforts are minimized,testers are able to deliver test cycles faster by automating repeated test cases.
--  Selenese is the language used to write selenium commands

Component:
1. Selenium IDE
2. Selenium RC
3. Selenium Grid
4. Selenium WebDriver

webdriver  - I   (chromedriver and others -C  )
================================================
-- Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests. This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly.

Selenium WebDriver allows you to choose a programming language to create test scripts



Benefits of Selenium WebDriver:
==============================
* It is one of the most popular Open-Source tools and is easy to get started with for testing web-based applications. It also allows you to perform cross browser compatibility testing.
* Supports multiple operating systems like Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix, etc.
* It provides compatibility with a range of languages, including Python, Java, Perl, Ruby, etc.
* Provides support for modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
* Selenium WebDriver completes the execution of test scripts faster when compared to other tools
* More Concise API (Application Programming interface) than Selenium RC’s
* It also provides compatibility with iPhoneDriver, HtmlUnitDriver, and AndroidDriver
* Selenium supports parallel test execution.
* Selenium can be integrated with TestNG and JUnit to generate test reports and manage test cases.
* Selenium can be integrated with Jenkins, Docker, and Maven to attain continuous testing. 

Drawbacks :
===========
* Selenium can test only web applications. It cannot test software applications and other desktop applications. 
* Selenium cannot access the web elements outside the web applications that are under test.
* No guaranteed user support is available. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selenese is the language used to write Selenium Commands. These Selenese commands are then used to test web-applications. Based on the HTML tags of the UI elements, one can check their existence. Commands help Selenium understand what actions or operations to perform.

Selenium commands are mainly categorized into three types:

1. Actions – Commands that are used or Help to manipulate or change the state of applications ,  (e.g. click on some link or select an option from a page).

2. Accessors – They are used to evaluate the application state & store results in a variable (e.g. 

3. Assertions – Help compare expected and actual results. They act like checkpoints and if both the values are equal, only then the test case passes or else it fails.Assertions help verify whether the state of the application after executing the test case conforms to the desired state (e.g. VerifyText, waitForPageToLoad). Assertions have three modes:
Assert
Verify
WaitFor

selenium jar files (client & web driver bindings)

	1. Create a new project in Eclipse?
	2. Create a new package under the project?
	3. And, create a new class under the package?
	4. How to Add  Selenium WebDriver Jars to the project?


Maximize browser window using Selenium Webdriver  ---  manage() method
			driver.manage().window().maximize();



Maven , add maven dependencies (POM.xml) (like selenium java jar file)

------------------------------------------------------

Setting up WebDriver in Selenium
=================================


simple script (setProperty --m,webdriver,driver)      1. Setting the driver path
steps to Instantiate WebDriver			      2. Creating WebDriver instance( initilizing the driver)
						      3. Navigate to web page ( launched )

1. To set Driver path in Selenium use:
 
 a) System.setProperty(“driver-name”,”driver-path”); - in this global level property is set to check the path for drivers. 

 b) WebDriverManager - WebDriverManager is a class in Selenium used to automate the handling of driver executables like chromedriver.exe, edgedriver.exe, firefoxdriver.exe, etc. 
Example: 
WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();


2. To create instance of the browser: (invoking the browser) 
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); //to perform testing in chrome browser 
WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver(); //to perform testing in Edge browser


3. WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of browser. 
ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc. are classes in Selenium contains 
methods which are used to automate respective browsers.

 a) ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 
In this the driver object has access to all the methods in ChromeDriver.

 b) WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 
In this the driver object has access to those methods of ChromeDriver which are 
common in WebDriver interface

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Web driver methods  .  	get()   open the app
			. getCurrentURL()  --- current url
			. getTitle()		title of page
			. getText()
			. getTagName()
			. getCSSValue()
			. getAttribute(string name)
			. quit()
			. close()


Browser Navigate methods  . driver.navigate().to(appUrl);    to back forward refresh
			  . driver.navigate().back()
			  . driver.navigate().forward() 
			  . driver.navigate().refresh() 


Web Elements methods    . findElement()
			. sendKeys() - used to enter text in the web element
			. submit() - used to submit a form
			. click() - used to perform click on the web element
			. clear() - used to clear entered text
			. isEnabled()
			. isDisplayed()
			. isSelected()


findElement(): This method uniquely finds a web element on the web page.
Syntax :  WebElement elementName = driver.findElement(By.LocatorStrategy("LocatorValue"));


findElements(): This method finds a list of web elements on the web page.
Syntax: List<WebElement> elementName = driver.findElements(By.LocatorStrategy("LocatorValue"));


findElement locators strategies	. id				By-- locator   By.Id
				. name
				. class name
				. tag name
				. CSS selector
				. XPath
				. linkText
				. Partiallinktext

driver.findElements(By.tagname("LocatorValue"));

---------------------------------------------------------------
CSS Selector : A CSS selector is a pattern string that uses CSS to target specific HTML elements on a web page.
		It can select elements by tags, class names, IDs, attribute values, and more with a simple syntax. CSS selectors are straightforward, making them a great tool for locating HTML nodes.  


Tag and id ----- #id  				 eg:  #password
Tag and class name				 eg:  .classname				
Tag and attributes ----tagname[att=value] 	 eg: input[placeholder=password]

contains(*)					input[id*=password]
starts-with(^)					input[id^=user]
end with($)  					input[id$=word]

first-of-type     				tagname#id>tagname:first-of-type
last-of-type					tagname[class=day]>tagname:last-of-type
nth-of-type					tag#id>tag:nth-of-type(6)
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Xpath :  XPath is a query language that locates the element by. Navigating through the XML 
document.


	. Absolute xpath  - It contains the complete path from root element to desire element
			    It is a direct way to find element 
			    Single forward slash (/)
		        eg:- /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/form[1]/div[1]/input[1]

	. Relative xpath  - It is simply like refrencing the element and go from particular location 
			    not a complete path from root element, can start from middle of HTML DOM structure
			    Double slash (//)
			    so relative xpath is always preferred
			eg:  //input[@placeholder="Username"]


Syntax:    //tagname[@attribute='value']
 	
//     		--  current node
tagname 	-- tagname of particular node like input, div etc
@		--  allows you to select attribute
attribute 	-- select attribute like id , name, classname etc
value		-- value of attribute


eg:-  	//input[@name='password']
      	//*[@id='login']
	//input[@type='text']
	//input[@class='username3241']
	//a[@href='https://www.google.com']
	//img[@src='../images/java.png']


* methods:       basic xpath  -- //tagname[@attribute='value']
		 contains     -- //tagname[contains(@attribute,'value')]
		 text 	      -- //tagname[text()='value']
		 starts-with  -- //tagname[starts-with(@attribute,'value')]
		 or ,and      -- //tagname[@attribute='value' or @attribute='value']
				 //tagname[@attribute='value' and @attribute='value']

		contains     //*[contains(@placeholder,'Username')]
		text         //h4[text()='Password for all users:']
		starts-with  //input[starts-with(@type,'submit')]
		OR	     //input[@type='text' or @id='user-name']
		AND	     //input[@type='text' and @id='user-name']

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Axes:
=====  
XPath Axes in Selenium WebDriver used to locate a web element which is not having any attributes on it's own, can't locate it directly using any of the locator strategy which selenium WebDriver provides except XPath and very useful to locate dynamic XPath. In such cases we can use XPath Axes mechanism to locate based on other web elements present in the HTML Document. We can use any one or all of the XPath axes names/method to locate any web element on given web page.

XPath Axes Names/Methods ========
    
1) Self -- Selects the current node
2) Parent -- Selects the parent of the current node
3) Child  --  Selects all children of the current node
4) Ancestor  --Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node
5) Descendant  --  Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node
6) Following-sibling  --  Selects all siblings after the current node
7) Preceding-sibling -- Selects all siblings before the current node

syntax:
//tagname[@attribute='value']/Axes::tagname[0]
//tagname[@attribute='value']/Axes::tagname/axes::tagname[0]

examples:
//div[@class='form_group']/descendant::input[1]
//div[@class='form_group']/parent::form/child::div[1]
//div[@class='form_group']/child::input[1]
//div[@class="form_group"]/parent::form

//div[@class="form_group"]/ancestor::div[@class="login_wrapper"]
//div[@class="form_group"]/ancestor::div[4]

//div[@class="form_group"]/child::input

//div[@class="error-message-container"]/preceding-sibling::div

Drop Down       Select --- The Select Class in Selenium is a method used to implement the HTML SELECT tag. methods to select and deselect the elements. The Select class is an ordinary class so New keyword is used to create its object and it specifies the web element location.

		selectByVisibleText()           single
		deselectByVisibleText()		multiple option
		selectByValue() 		single
		deselectByValue()		multiple option
		selectByIndex()			single
		deselectByIndex()		multiple option
	        isMultiple()       --  boolean  returns TRUE if the drop-down element allows multiple selection at a 										time; FALSE if otherwise
		deselectAll()	-- Clears all selected entries. This is only valid when the drop-down element supports multiple selections.
		getFirstSelectedOption()  -- This method returns the first selected option of the dropdown
		getAllSelectedOption()    --  This method returns all the selected options of the dropdown
		getOptions()		-- There are times when you need to get all the options in a dropdown or multi-select box. This is where you can use the getOptions() method of the Select class.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frame :- Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain.
		The frame enables a developer to split the screen horizontally or vertically by using the frameset tag.
		An iframe is also known as an inline frame.
		 An iframe tag is defined using <iframe></iframe> tags
		

Handle Frames   driver.switchTo().frame();  ---  by index,id&name ,parent , frame element
<iframe>

drivedr.switchTO().Frame(index)
drivedr.switchTO().Frame(name & id)
drivedr.switchTO().Frame(WebElement)
drivedr.switchTO().parentFrame(), defaultContent()

. switchTo()  --  helps to switch between the Frames

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actions  class	---  it is a built in feature provided by selenium for handling mouse and keyboard events
			 build()   perform()
	    	  with movetoElement & without , sendkeys()
		
	methods ----		single , double, right(context) ,sendkeys(), drag and drop


	actions					webelement
	
	sendkeys()				sendkeys()

	simulate the keyboard key		typing ther text into the text fields
	by press and release

	like tab,enter,down,up etc		like "username"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Handling multiple windows  --  It is a unique identifier that holds the address of all the windows .(as a pointer to a window) . so each browser has a unique window handle.


	. getWindowHandle() -- This method helps to get the window handle of the current window ,returns string ,we get unique ID of the current window (identified within driver instance.)
	. getWindowHandles() -- this method helps to get the handles of all the windows opened,stores in set of string type,to handle all opened windows,transition from 1 window to another
	. switchTo()  --  helps to switch between the windows
	. set -- this method helps to set the window handles in the form of string.  set<String>(returns the set of handles)

	. newWindow 	driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.TAB);			        driver.switchTo().newWindow(WindowType.WINDOW);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wait Synchronization:
=====================
--  coordination process between the components is termed Synchronisation.
-- Synchronisationin Selenium executes the code and applications, which must be in synchronisation to perform the operation.
--  wait command in selenium direct test script to pause for certain time before throwing "ElementNotVisibleException" ,  NoSuchElementException , InvalidSelectorException , TimeoutExcetion
--Synchronisation in Selenium
--Synchronisation refers to the idea that the speed of the automated test should coincide with the speed of Application under test (AUT). 
--This is because if the test and application are not executing in parallel, then the test cases might fail. 


Types of Synchronisation in Selenium 
-- Unconditional Synchronisation: For implementing this only timeout value is 
required. 
 Using this WebDriver will wait for the specified time. 
 Example - Thread.sleep(1000); 
. sleep() -- Static wait , it stop the script

-- Conditional Synchronisation: By using conditional synchronisation, a specified 
time along with certain conditions can be allocated and if the condition fails the a 
error message is thrown. 

There are three types of Conditional Synchronisation:

   1. Implicit wait -- 

dynamic wait , global ( tells the web driver to wait for certain amount of time before it throws 
---exception as nosuchelement found ,  it will wait till maximum of the seconds given   
--- driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait(duration.ofSeconds());

-	When finding the element in any webpage selenium doesn't wait for any time, so if the element is not available 	immediately then selenium webdriver will throw the exception i.e: NoSuchElementException 
	For eg: element A takes 0sec to find and element B takes 2sec to find
- You can allow the selenium webdriver to wait for some time to find the element using Implicit Wait Timeout.

====================================

   2. Explicit wait(WebDriver wait) -- 

dynamic , applicable to particular webelement like button,textbox & if the elements taking bit time to load then we can specify explicit to those element to appear first then proceed
- Explicit wait is applied for specific elements on page which take more time load or appear.

-	The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or 	maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements.

-	WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds());
		wait.until(ExpectedConditions)
-    define “WebDriverWait” class on the webpage until the “ExpectedConditions” are met.

======================================
   3. Fluent wait -- 

dynamic ,we can specify polling frequency (if element take long time but u want it to be checked by small interval of time i.e polling ), specify exculsion of the exception that can happen , similar to explicit wait

-	The Fluent Wait in Selenium is used to define maximum time for the web driver to wait for a condition, as well as the 	frequency with which we want to check the condition before throwing an “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. It checks 	for the web element at regular intervals until the object is found or timeout happens.

-	Frequency: Setting up a repeat cycle with the time frame to verify/check the condition at the regular interval of time

-	Wait<WebDriver> wait=new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)
		.withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds())
		.pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds())
		.withMessage("Fluent wait")
		.ignoring(Exception.class);
		wait.until(ExpectedConditions);

------------------------------
. driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robots  --- users need control over keyboard or mouse to interact with OS windows like download pop-ups, print pop-ups, etc. and native applications like notepad, calculator, etc. It is generally used to simulate real-time keyboard and mouse operations which we do manually.

mouseMove(int x, int y): Method to move the mouse pointer to the given screen coordinate
mousePress(int buttons): Method to press one or more mouse buttons
mouseRelease(int buttons): Method to release one or more mouse buttons

InputEvent.BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK :  For mouse left -click
InputEvent.BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK  : For mouse middle button click.
InputEvent.BUTTON3_DOWN_MASK : For mouse right-click

keyPress(): Ex: robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN) : This method with press down arrow key of Keyboard
keyRelease() : Ex: robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN) : This method with release down arrow key of Keyboard
To press down arrow key of Keyboard we use (robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_DOWN))
To press TAB key of keyboard (we use robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_TAB))
To press Enter key we use (robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER)).
To press ctrl+A , ctrl+C , ctrl+V   robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_CONTROL),robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_A)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Screenshots  ---I     TakesScreenshot         	getScreenShotAs() -- method
dependency -- apache common IO

A Screenshot in Selenium Webdriver is used for bug analysis.If users need to capture a screenshot , they need to use the TakeScreenshot method which notifies the WebDrive to take the screenshot and store it in Selenium.

1) Convert web driver object to TakeScreenshot
TakesScreenshot scrShot =((TakesScreenshot)webdriver);

2) Call getScreenshotAs method to create image file
File SrcFile=scrShot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

3) Copy file to Desired Location

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Javascript executor  : -- I
		-- It is an interface which provides mechanism to execute javascript through selenium driver .
		-- javascript is a programming language that interacts with HTML in a browser , & to use this function in selenium  javaScriptExecutor is required

* Two methods
1. ExecuteScript : execute javascript in the currently selected window or frame. 
2. ExecuteAsyncScript : execute asynchronous javascript in the current window or frame.


* STEPS :	
	1. Import the package -- Import org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor;
	2. Create a reference -- JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
	3. Call the JavascriptExecutor method -- js.executeScript(script, args);

	JavaScriptExecutor js=(JavaScriptExecutor)driver;
	refresh  -- js.executeScript("location.reload()");
	ScrollBy(H,V)  --- js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,450)");
	setAttribute    give the value
	getAttribute	fetch and print it in console
	click()       
js.executeScript("argument[0])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TDD -

1.) TestNG :- TestNG is a testing framework that is capable of making Selenium tests easier to understand and of generating reports that are easy to understand.

TestNG is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for “Next Generation”. TestNG is inspired by JUnit which uses the annotations (@). TestNG overcomes the disadvantages of JUnit and is designed to make end-to-end testing easy.
Using TestNG, you can generate a proper report, and you can easily come to know how many test cases are passed, failed, and skipped. You can execute the failed test cases separately.	

TestNG Annotations are used to control the next method to be executed in the test script. TestNG annotations are defined before every method in the test code.

- It is an Open-source Java testing framework, which is not limited till unit testing. 
- TestNG stands for Test Next Generation. 
- Using TestNG we can generate proper report. 
- Multiple test cases can be group together more easily in TestNG. 
- It can execute multiple test cases in multiple browser, i.e. cross browser testing. 
- Parallel testing is possible.



2.) advantages of TestNG over JUnit:

-- Annotations are easier to understand
-- Test cases can be grouped more easily
-- Parallel testing is possible
-- TestNG is capable of generating HTML-based reports.
-- Annotations can use parameters
-- TestNG Dataprovider is a way to pass parameters into the test function which passes different values in test cases in a single execution.

3.) steps
-- install TestNG from Eclipse workspace
-- Install jar files for java & dependency in maven project

3.)  @Test  -- Run All  & Run|Debug

testng xml --- is a config file , what we want to execute and which order we want to execute , how many times 

4.)  Asserts --It's a class file provided by TestNG

Assert in Selenium WebDriver is used for verifying or validating the scenario under test. Based on the result of the Assert, the outcome (i.e. pass/fail) of the test can be decided. A test scenario is considered as passed if the ‘achieved test result’ matches with the ‘expected test result’.

5)  types  :-  hard &  soft
	hard -- means assert
	soft --  assertAll() to throw exception

*  Assert in Selenium WebDriver are Hard Asserts By Default
*  Assert(Hard Assert):
======================
. test execution is halted when the condition as part of the assert is not met. 
.Hard asserts usually throw an Assertion Error (i.e. java.lang.AssertionError) and the test scenario is marked as failed as soon as the hard assert condition fails. 
.The Assertion Error should be handled in the try..catch block in Java.

*  Soft Assert:
===============
 soft asserts do not throw any exception on the failure of the assert and continue to the next step even after encountering an assert.
. Soft assert collects all the asserts encountered when running the @Test methods. The assertAll() method is called to throw all the exceptions caught during the process of Selenium test automation execution.
. Soft Asserts are not included by default in the TestNG framework. You have to include the package org.testng.asserts.Softassert when soft assert has to be used in the tests.
. Once the assert statement fails, the current test is skipped and the test suite continues with the next @Test

 if you need your @Test Method to fail straight away after one of its Asserts fails, use Hard Asserts. If you want the execution to proceed even if an assert fails, if you want to see how the following asserts behave, and if you want to see the full result at the end of the test, you need to use Soft Asserts.

---------------------------------------------
methods :
assertEquals
assertNotEquals
assertTrue	(anywhere u r getting boolean values from websites u can check those by this methods)
assertFalse
assertNull   (for object  , as obj created or other obj to check they are null or not)
assertNotNull


.Annotations :- (@) Annotations in TestNG are lines of code that can control how the method below them will be executed.

@BeforeSuite
@AfterSuite
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeTest
@AfterTest
@BeforeGroup
@AfterGroup


. @Test:  TestCases and Main method

. @BeforeMethod: This will be executed before every @test annotated method.

. @AfterMethod: This will be executed after every @test annotated method.

. @BeforeClass: This will be executed before first @Test method execution. It will be executed one only time throughout the   	test case.

. @AfterClass: This will be executed after all test methods in the current class have been run

. @BeforeTest: This will be executed before the first @Test annotated method. It can be executed multiple times before the   		test case.

. @AfterTest: A method with this annotation will be executed when all @Test annotated methods complete the execution of those   classes inside the <test> tag in the TestNG.xml file.

. @BeforeSuite: It will run only once, before all tests in the suite are executed.

. @AfterSuite: A method with this annotation will run once after the execution of all tests in the suite is complete.

. @BeforeGroups: This method will run before the first test run of that specific group.

. @AfterGroups: This method will run after all test methods of that group complete their execution.

==============
. priority: (priority = 1) or (priority = -1)
	we can pass priority to the particular testcases
	we can pass negative & positive values
	It will execute based on the ascending order
	If we give same priority then it will execute based on the alphabetic order.
================
. Ignoring the testcases: (enabled = false)
	for ignoring the testcases , we can use one method called enabled
	when the enabled = false , It will skip the particular testcases
================
. Invocation count: (invocationCount = 2)
	If u want run the particular testcases for n number of times , we can use one method called innvocation class
	It will run the testcases for that particular times
=================
. depends on methods  
=================
. timeout : The maximum time a test execution should take. If exceeded, the test fails automatically. (timeOut = 6000)
===================
. expectedExceptions:-
expectedExceptions = NoSuchElementException.class
expectedExceptions Is very good feature of testng using which we can Ignore known but not required exceptions. In your selenium webdriver test execution, You can use expectedExceptions when you know that any specific @Test method can throw specific exception but It Is not much more Important and you wants to Ignore that exception.

If you have used expectedExceptions attribute with @Test method then Whenever Exceptions thrown In @Test method, It will compare It with expectedExceptions attribute's value. If both match then It will be handled by TestNG. That means your @Test method will be pass and remaining part of that method will be skipped.
=========================
@dataProvider:
	To pass the different datas for same test case
	return type of data provider is 2 dimensional array
	if you want to access the data provider outside the class mention the data provider as static.
===============
. @parameters: 
	-- when you want to pass the input from XML
	-- @parameters annotation needs to be used
===============
-- @optional 
In this annotation, if the defined parameter is not found in the testng.xml file, Then Test method will receive the default value from the @Optional annotation.When parameters name is not matched , then we give @optional. you have to pass the value at the time of initialization  , public void log(@Optional("name")String username)

-- If both @parameters and @optional are used , where parameters name is matched , then preference will be given to 	parameter value
================

. Groups(define) : TestNG Groups allow you to perform groupings of different test methods. Grouping of test methods is required when you want to access the test methods of different classes.
Exclude Tag:  Syntax for exclude tag <exclude name="${TEST_CASE_NAME}" />
Include Tag:  Syntax for include tag <include name="${TEST_CASE_NAME}" />
define
run

=================	
Parallel: Parallel testing or parallel execution, as the name suggests, is a process of running the test case parallelly rather than one after the other.   In parallel testing, the program's multiple parts (or modules) execute together, saving the testers a lot of time and effort. (Fails On Dependent Modules)Parallel testing allows independent running of modules simultaneously. 
parallel= ""  
. Methods: This will run the parallel tests on all @Test methods in TestNG.
. Tests: All the test cases present inside the <test> tag will run with this value.
. Classes: All the test cases present inside the classes that exist in the XML will run in parallel.

Thread count is basically a number of instances running to execute multiple tests simultaneously or in parallel. The attribute thread-count allows the user to specify how many threads should be run for this execution.

--Thread.currentThread().getId()
parallel="tests" thread-count="2"

-- threadPoolSize: The number of threads we would like to create and run the test parallelly.


Parallel Test Execution in TestNG:
==================================
There are situations where you want to run multiple tests at the same time. 
For Parallel test execution using TestNG, inside the suite tag in testing.xml we can 
create an attribute called parallel. 
Thread-count attribute is used to tell that 2 instances of web driver can parallel in two 
different browser. 

<?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“UTF-8”?> 
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM “https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd”> 
<suite name=“suite” thread-count=“2” parallel=“classes”> 
<test name=“test1”> 
<classes> 
<class name=“com.demo.class_name1”/> 
<class name=“com.demo.class_name2”/> 
</classes> 
</test> 
</suite> 

Parallel attribute can accept 4 values 
i. tests - All the tests cases inside test tag of testng.xml file will run in parallel. 
ii. classes - All the cases inside Java class will run in parallel 
iii. methods - All the methods with @Test annotation will execute in parallel. 

==========================
Cross-browser testing : it is the process of testing our website on different browsers and operating systems. With cross-browser testing, we make sure that the site is rendered the same in every browser. We can perform cross-browser testing either manually or in an automated way, but the manual method is very tedious. The reason being that while performing cross-browser testing, we do not only care about the browsers but their different versions and the operating systems too.

Cross-browser testing using TestNG ensure a better performance on different browsers and OS.
================================		

Working of TestNG Annotations :-
1. Launching the browser will be the first step and hence it is included under the @BeforeTest Annotation.
2. Next is the actual test case which verifies the title, and is therefore included in the @Test annotation.
3. Finally, the quit browser test case is considered under the @AfterTest annotation.

Exceptions:-
WebDriver Exceptions in Selenium:
There are many exceptions occurs while using Selenium tool. Here we will discuss most common exceptions.

I have divided the exceptions in different category.

Not Found exception:
=====================
NoSuchWindowException: Webdriver trying to switch on an invalid window.

NoSuchFrameException: WebDriver trying to switch to an invalid frame.

NoSuchElementException: If we have given wrong locator or element is not present is DOM.

NoAlertPresentException: WebDriver trying to switch to an invalid alert.

TimeOutException: When the selenium takes longer time than the given wait time then it throws TimeOutException.

StaleElementReferenceException: If element is no longer present in the DOM due to page got refreshed or a frame/window switched or navigate to another page.


InvalidElementState Exception:
==============================
ElementNotVisibleException: If element is present but visibility is off or If synchronization issue between Selenium and web application or if we have used duplicate xpath then this exception is thrown.

ElementNotSelectableException:  if an element is disable (element is not clicked/selected) .


java.lang.illegalargumentexception in selenium
==============================================
In Selenium, when we have given null or string length is zero in sendKeys() method the n it throw this exception.


Element not visible exception is thrown when:
==============================================

There are many reasons which are mentioned below.

1. If we try to locate a web element which is not visible or hidden on screen then we will get the element not visible exception.
2. Synchronization problem: If Selenium is faster than application or vice versa.
3. If we have used duplicate xpath in our script means more than one web element have same xpath.
4. Sometimes weblement is not on the visible area of the screen (means when we scrolled down the screen then element is visible)

--> how to solve such exceptions
Solution 1: synchroniztion
Solution 2: Always use the unique path that matches only a single element.
Solution 3: We can use try.. catch block to handle this exception.
---------------------------
1. Solution 1: synchroniztion

-- For 1st and 2nd above problem means when element will visible then we will perform operations.
-- Here we can wait until the element is not visible. Once it will visible then we can perform an action.

-- Here we can different wait commands.

*) Thead.sleep(): It is not recommended because we never know in how much time the element will visible on the screen. It might be increasing our test execution.		Thread.sleep(30);
*) Implicit wait: It is also not recommended because it will apply whole line of code in the given test script which increase the execution time.		driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlywait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
*) Explicit wait: It is recommended because it provides different expected conditions which we can use till we want to wait.
		WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 20);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(“Locator”)));

------------------------------
In case of element is not in visibility area of the screen then first we need to scroll the web page using javaScriptExecutor then perform an action.

JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", element);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Repository:
==================
-Object Repository is a centralized storage/ common storage of locators in the form of objects
-An Object Repository is a map between UI element and its locator. Which can also be written as an Object Map between UI element and the way to find it. 
-In Selenium WebDriver's context it means a Mapping between WebElement and the corresponding locator type and value. create property file by(.properties)

login.username.xpath=//input[@id='user-name']
passwordId=password
logxpath=.//input[@id='login-button']
